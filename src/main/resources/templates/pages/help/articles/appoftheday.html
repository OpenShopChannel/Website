{% block subtitle %}The Open Shop Channel website showcases an "App of the Day" on the homepage.{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
    The "App of the Day" is chosen completely randomly once per 24 hours.<br>
    It exists to promote lesser known applications by highlighting them for a whole day at a time on the home page.<br><br>
    Currently, apps must meet the following conditions to appear as apps of the day:
    <ul>
        <li>The app includes a short description.</li>
        <li>The app is not in the "demos" category.</li>
        <li>The app supports at least one Wii Remote.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Additionally, apps are only selected from the main repository.
